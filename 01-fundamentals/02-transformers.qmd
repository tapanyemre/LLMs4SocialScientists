## Session 1: Vector Embeddings Deep Dive (30 minutes)

### Understanding How Words Become Numbers

**Key Concept**: Vector embeddings transform words into numerical representations that capture meaning and relationships.

**Exercise**: Vector Embeddings Practice
- Explore how words are represented as vectors
- Understand similarity and distance in vector space
- Practice with word analogies and relationships

**You'll learn**: How words become numbers that preserve meaning

### Vector Database Applications
- **Similarity search**: Finding related concepts
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar ideas
- **Recommendation systems**: Suggesting related content
- **Research applications**: Literature review and synthesis

## Session 2: Self-Attention Mechanism by Hand (40 minutes)

### The Heart of Transformer Architecture

**Key Concept**: Self-attention allows positions to attend to other positions in the sequence, capturing relationships between words.

**Exercise**: Self-Attention Calculation
- Calculate attention scores step-by-step
- Understand query, key, and value matrices
- Practice attention computation by hand
- Visualize attention patterns

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```

### Why Attention Matters
- **Context understanding**: Words can attend to relevant context
- **Long-range dependencies**: Capture relationships across long sequences
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights show what the model focuses on
- **Flexibility**: Can attend to any position in the sequence

## Session 3: Complete Transformer Architecture (25 minutes)

### From Attention to Full Model

**Exercise**: Transformer Architecture Walkthrough
- Understand the complete transformer structure
- Explore encoder and decoder components
- Practice with a complete example
- Connect to real-world applications

### Transformer Components
- **Input Embeddings**: Convert words to vectors
- **Positional Encoding**: Add position information
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention mechanisms
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process attended information
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize training
- **Residual Connections**: Help with gradient flow

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Mathematical Foundation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Vector Embeddings** | Dense numerical representations of words/concepts | Continuous vector space mapping |
| **Self-Attention** | Mechanism allowing positions to attend to other positions | Scaled dot-product: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V |
| **Query, Key, Value** | Three matrices that enable attention computation | Linear projections: Q=XW_Q, K=XW_K, V=XW_V |

## Connection to Research

### Why Transformers Matter for Social Science
- **Text understanding**: Better comprehension of complex documents
- **Context awareness**: Models understand relationships between concepts
- **Scalability**: Can process large amounts of text efficiently
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights show what models focus on

### Research Applications
