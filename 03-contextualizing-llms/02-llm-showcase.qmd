## Session 2: Building with Gradio (45 minutes)

### What is Gradio?

**Gradio** is a Python library that makes it easy to create web interfaces for machine learning models. It's perfect for creating demos and prototypes of AI applications.

### Basic Gradio Interface

```python
import gradio as gr

def analyze_text(text):
    # Your LLM analysis function
    result = llm_analyze(text)
    return result

# Create interface
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=analyze_text,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(label="Enter your text"),
    outputs=gr.Textbox(label="Analysis result"),
    title="Text Analysis Tool",
    description="Analyze text using AI"
)

iface.launch()
```

### Advanced Gradio Features

**Multiple Inputs and Outputs**
```python
def research_analyzer(text, analysis_type, confidence_threshold):
    # Process multiple inputs
    result = analyze_with_parameters(text, analysis_type, confidence_threshold)
    return result, confidence_score, suggestions

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=research_analyzer,
    inputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="Research text"),
        gr.Dropdown(choices=["themes", "sentiment", "topics"], label="Analysis type"),
        gr.Slider(minimum=0, maximum=1, label="Confidence threshold")
    ],
    outputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="Analysis"),
        gr.Number(label="Confidence"),
        gr.Textbox(label="Suggestions")
    ]
)
```

**File Upload and Processing**
```python
def process_survey_file(file):
    # Process uploaded survey data
    results = analyze_survey_data(file.name)
    return results

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=process_survey_file,
    inputs=gr.File(label="Upload survey responses"),
    outputs=gr.JSON(label="Analysis results")
)
```
