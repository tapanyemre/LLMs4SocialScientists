## Learning Philosophy

This course is designed specifically for social science researchers who want to understand and use Large Language Models (LLMs) in their work. We take a progressive approach that builds from fundamental concepts to practical applications.

### Why This Matters for Social Science Research

LLMs are transforming how we can analyze text, conduct research, and interact with data. Understanding these tools allows you to:

- **Analyze large text datasets** more efficiently
- **Generate research hypotheses** from literature reviews
- **Create survey instruments** and interview protocols
- **Process qualitative data** at scale
- **Communicate findings** more effectively

## Course Structure

### Chapter 1: Fundamentals of LLMs
**Building the Foundation**
- Neural network basics and mathematical understanding
- Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
- How modern LLMs process and generate text

### Chapter 2: LLMs in Action
**Practical Applications**
- Exploring LLM capabilities and limitations
- Working with APIs and interfaces
- Hands-on practice with real models

### Chapter 3: Contextualizing LLMs
**Advanced Applications**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques
- Knowledge graphs and advanced context methods
- Building complete applications with user interfaces

## Learning Approach

### Progressive Complexity
Each chapter builds upon the previous one, ensuring you have a solid foundation before moving to more advanced topics.

### Hands-On Practice
Theory is always paired with practical exercises, allowing you to immediately apply what you learn.

### Research-Focused Examples
All examples and exercises are designed with social science research applications in mind.

## What You'll Need

### Technical Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Python (we'll provide refreshers)
- Access to Google Colab (free, no installation required)
- Willingness to work through mathematical concepts step-by-step

### Mindset
- Curiosity about how AI tools work
- Patience with technical concepts
- Interest in applying new tools to research problems
- Openness to discussing limitations and biases

## Getting the Most from This Course

### Before Each Chapter
- Complete the pre-reading materials
- Set up your technical environment
- Review any prerequisites

### During Each Chapter
- Work through exercises step-by-step
- Don't rush through mathematical concepts
- Ask questions when something isn't clear
- Reflect on how concepts apply to your research

### After Each Chapter
- Reflect on what you learned
- Practice with your own examples
- Connect to the next chapter's content
- Consider attending BLISS workshops for hands-on practice
