# BLISS Learning: Large Language Models for Social Science Research

A comprehensive course on Large Language Models designed specifically for social science researchers, created by the **Boston LLMs Initiative for Social Scientists (BLISS)**.

## About BLISS

**BLISS** organizes funded workshop series teaching social science researchers how to use large language models in their work, while discussing limitations and biases. This book represents the collective knowledge from our workshop series and ongoing research initiatives.

## About This Book

This book provides a progressive learning path from neural network fundamentals to advanced LLM applications in social science research. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation for understanding and using AI tools in research.

## Course Structure

### Chapter 0: Getting Started
- Course overview and learning approach
- Technical setup and environment preparation
- Learning strategies for technical concepts
- Research applications and ethical considerations

### Chapter 1: Fundamentals of LLMs
- Neural network basics and mathematical foundations
- Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
- Understanding how modern LLMs work

### Chapter 2: LLMs in Action
- Exploring LLM capabilities and limitations
