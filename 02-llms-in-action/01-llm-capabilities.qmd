# LLM Capabilities and Limitations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of modern LLMs
- Use Hugging Face to explore different models
- Recognize when LLMs are appropriate for research tasks
- Identify potential biases and limitations in LLM outputs
- Apply LLMs to basic text analysis tasks

## Introduction

This chapter introduces you to real Large Language Models through hands-on exploration. You'll learn what LLMs can and cannot do, and how to use them responsibly in your research.

## Pre-Chapter Learning (30 minutes)

### Materials:
1. **Hugging Face Introduction** (15 minutes)
   - [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/course) - Introduction to the platform
   - [Model Hub Overview](https://huggingface.co/models) - Understanding available models

2. **LLM Capabilities Overview** (15 minutes)
   - [What Can Language Models Do?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062) - Research paper on capabilities
   - [Limitations of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910) - Understanding limitations

## Session 1: Exploring LLM Capabilities (45 minutes)

### What LLMs Can Do

**Text Generation**
- Complete sentences and paragraphs
- Generate creative content
- Answer questions based on training data
- Translate between languages

**Text Classification**
- Categorize documents by topic
- Identify sentiment in text
- Detect spam or inappropriate content
- Classify research papers by field

**Question Answering**
- Answer factual questions
- Provide explanations
- Generate summaries
- Extract information from text

**Code Generation**
- Write simple code snippets
- Debug existing code
- Explain code functionality
- Generate documentation

### Hands-On Exercise: Model Exploration

```python
# Example: Exploring different models
from transformers import pipeline

# Text classification
classifier = pipeline("text-classification")
result = classifier("I love this research paper!")
print(result)

# Question answering
qa = pipeline("question-answering")
context = "The study found that social media use is associated with increased anxiety."
question = "What did the study find?"
answer = qa(question=question, context=context)
print(answer)
```

## Session 2: Understanding LLM Limitations (45 minutes)

### What LLMs Cannot Do

**Factual Accuracy**
- May generate incorrect information
- Cannot access real-time data
- Limited to training data cutoff
- May "hallucinate" plausible but false information

**Reasoning and Logic**
- Struggle with complex reasoning
- May make logical errors
- Limited mathematical capabilities
- Cannot perform true understanding

**Bias and Fairness**
- Reflect biases in training data
- May perpetuate stereotypes
- Can amplify existing inequalities
- Requires careful evaluation

**Context Understanding**
- Limited context window
- May miss nuanced meaning
- Can be sensitive to prompt wording
- May not understand domain-specific knowledge

### Exercise: Identifying Limitations

**Task**: Analyze LLM outputs for potential issues
- Test factual accuracy with known information
- Evaluate bias in responses
- Check for logical consistency
- Assess domain knowledge limitations

## Session 3: Practical Applications for Research (30 minutes)

### Research Use Cases

**Literature Review**
- Summarize research papers
- Identify key themes and findings
- Generate research questions
- Create annotated bibliographies

**Survey Analysis**
- Code open-ended responses
- Identify common themes
- Generate follow-up questions
- Analyze sentiment in responses

**Content Generation**
- Draft research summaries
- Create presentation outlines
- Generate grant proposal sections
- Write accessible explanations

**Data Preprocessing**
- Clean and standardize text data
- Remove irrelevant content
- Identify and handle missing data
- Prepare data for analysis

### Exercise: Research Application

```python
# Example: Analyzing survey responses
responses = [
    "I feel overwhelmed by social media pressure",
    "Social media helps me stay connected",
    "I spend too much time on my phone"
]

# Use LLM to identify themes
for response in responses:
    # Analyze sentiment and themes
    # Generate coding categories
    # Identify key concepts
    pass
```

## Ethical Considerations

### Responsible Use Guidelines

**Transparency**
- Document all LLM usage in methods
- Disclose when AI tools are used
- Be clear about limitations
- Share prompts and parameters

**Evaluation**
- Always verify LLM outputs
- Cross-check with reliable sources
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Acknowledge potential biases

**Privacy**
- Don't share sensitive data with LLMs
- Be careful with participant information
- Consider data retention policies
- Protect confidential information

**Fairness**
- Evaluate outputs for bias
- Consider diverse perspectives
- Test with different populations
- Acknowledge limitations

## Connection to Research

### When to Use LLMs

**Appropriate Uses**
- Initial exploration of large datasets
- Generating research hypotheses
- Creating draft content
- Automating routine tasks

**Inappropriate Uses**
- Making final research decisions
- Replacing human judgment
- Analyzing sensitive data
- Generating definitive conclusions

### Best Practices

**For Literature Reviews**
- Use LLMs to identify themes and patterns
- Always verify key findings manually
- Cross-reference with original sources
- Maintain critical perspective

**For Survey Analysis**
- Use LLMs for initial coding
- Verify coding with human review
- Consider multiple coding approaches
- Document coding decisions

**For Content Generation**
- Use LLMs for drafting and brainstorming
- Always edit and review generated content
- Maintain your voice and perspective
- Ensure accuracy and appropriateness
